Bank_account
============

A Java Banking application.

The bank.java file contains the java source code and the bank.mdb is the database file.

The following java code acts as a bank server, with user account database, account information, transaction details, etcâ€¦. .
You can do a variety of functions which you can clearly see on running it, as it has a GUI.
the default username is administrator and password is admin.

I have removed the client-server(socket progamming) functionality for the time-being as I am going to implement a
chatting interface using JSP and serverlets.

Feel free to mail me if you have any problems or want the socket programming code part.
